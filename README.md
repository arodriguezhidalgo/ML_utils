# ML_utils
v0.5:
* Implemented Dropout and BatchNorm for the NeuralNetwork.
* Attempted to include Residual lines in NeuralNetwork, although it needs to be checked.

v0.4:
* Added some code to create and fit a Dense neural network.
* Slight mods in the param_dist for Regressors.

v0.3:
* Some code to extract features. 
* I need to include a script with auditory features using librosa. 

v0.2:
* Included some functions for classification. I still have to implement a class for such task, similar to Regression.py.

v0.1:
* Regression class code for Time Series data.
